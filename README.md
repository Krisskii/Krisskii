ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris @Krisskii and I am a 25 year old student and I am self teaching myself programming.

I have recently finished a dedicated Data Engineering bootcamp provided by an English company QA. 
The bootcamp was focused on active exercises based on: 
  - Microsoft Azure
  - Python
  - MySQL
  - PowerBI
  - Fundamental knowledge of Machine learning using Microsoft Azure

The course has been suplemented with Microsoft DP-900 certification that I have passed.

Apart from that I am currently self teaching myself Python to further develop my skills, with the help of Youtube and Udemy I am slowly creating more and more projects that you can find in the portfolio. 
I am an IT High school graduate and I have the fundamental mindset from school of a 'can do' approach. I have previously had experience in building responsive websites using HTML, CSS and jQuery.

I enjoy both the front and back end of software development and would like to further develop my skills to progress into a junior software developer in the future, hopeing to build on the skills that I already have.
